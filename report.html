<!--
must include at least an ordered list where you briefly 
explain how your site meets all of these requirements 
(or if you aren't going to meet a requirement, you explicitly 
write that you did not meet that requirement).

i.e. first item in your list should say like 
1. this is the url to our github repo which is shared with each other 
      and the prof: http://github.com/...
2. this is the url to our deployed application where anyone could 
      try our app: http://example.github.io/...
...
13. Right now we are thinking that the 2 APIs we will use are 
      https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide and 
      https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference
